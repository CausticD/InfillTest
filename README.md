# InfillTest

This is a simple model that has a curved outer surface that uses an exposed Gyroid infill. This is designed to test your settings to get a great look for the Vector Finesse (https://shop.vectorfinesse.com/) head(amame) Open Back headphones.

The key setting is "Max comb distance with no retract" in Cura. Setting this to something like 0.2mm, massively down from the default of 30mm

To use this, either drag the premade .3mf into Cura or your slicer of choice, or run the batch file to re-export the scad file into a 3mf using my Smart3MF tool.
